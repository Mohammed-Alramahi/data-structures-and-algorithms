# Stacks and Queues

Stacks: A stack is an abstract data type that holds an ordered, linear sequence of items. a stack is a last in, first out (LIFO) structure.

Queue: A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO).

## Challenge

To Implement the stacks and queues data stractures.

## Approach & Efficiency

I took the approach of implementing them using linked list as required.

for **big O:**

both of them have a time complexity O(n) and a space complexity O(1) because both of them works linearly.

## API

**Stack:**

- push: add Items to the stack.
- pop: remove Items from the stack.
- isEmpty: check wheter the stack is empty or not.
- peek: retrieves the top of the stack.

**Queue:**

- enqueue: add Items to the queue.
- dequeue: remove Items from the queue.
- isEmpty: check wheter the queue is empty or not.
- peek: retrieves the top of the queue.
