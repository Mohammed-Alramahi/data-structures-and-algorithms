# BST-BFS

 a binary search tree, also called an ordered or sorted binary tree, is a rooted binary tree whose internal nodes each store a key greater than all the keys in the node's left subtree and less than those in its right subtree.

## The Challenge

To have the ability to traverse through the tree using BFS.

## API

1. add: adds new node to the tree
1. contains: search for a certain value in the tree and return true or false based on it.
1. breadthFirst(tree): traverse through the tree using BFS by passing a tree.
