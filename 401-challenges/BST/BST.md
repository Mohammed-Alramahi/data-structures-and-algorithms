# BST

 a binary search tree, also called an ordered or sorted binary tree, is a rooted binary tree whose internal nodes each store a key greater than all the keys in the node's left subtree and less than those in its right subtree.

## The Challenge

To have the ability to add and search in a binary tree with a given order.
